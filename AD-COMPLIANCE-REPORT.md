## Ad-Safe Language Guidelines

### ‚úÖ SAFE TO USE:
- "Learn", "Training", "Education", "Mentorship"
- "Tools", "Templates", "Resources", "Support"
- "Access to", "Includes", "Features"
- Actual product features (videos, tools, community)
- Legitimate price urgency (limited time pricing)

### ‚ùå NEVER USE IN ADS OR LANDING PAGES:
- Specific timeframes for success ("30 days", "week 1")
- "Guarantee" + results/income/clients
- "First client", "Book calls"
- "Replace income", "Quit your job"
- "Easy", "Fast", "Quick" + money/success

### ‚ö†Ô∏è USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION:
- Any numbers related to earnings or client acquisition
- Testimonials with specific results
- Time-based claims (even for learning)

---

## Disclaimer Requirements

### Current Disclaimer (Footer):
‚úÖ GOOD - but needs to be MORE PROMINENT

### Required Additional Disclaimers:

**1. Near ALL testimonials:**
```
*Results not typical. Individual experiences vary based on effort, skill,
and market conditions. No guarantee of similar results.
```

**2. Near countdown timer:**
```
*Price guarantee only. No income or results guaranteed.
```

**3. Top of page (recommended):**
```
Educational program only. Success depends on individual effort and factors
outside our control. See full disclaimer below.
```

---

## Implementation Priority

### üî¥ MUST FIX BEFORE RUNNING ADS (Critical):
1. ‚úì Remove "30 days" from Hero headline
2. ‚úì Remove "30 days" from page title/metadata
3. ‚úì Remove "book your first client" language
4. ‚úì Remove "week 1" timeframe claim
5. ‚úì Modify testimonial quotes to remove specific timeframes
6. ‚úì Change "Book at least one discovery call" in guarantee

### üü° STRONGLY RECOMMENDED (High Risk):
7. Add prominent disclaimer at top of page
8. Change "replaced my day job leads" testimonial
9. Soften "Eliminates" language in value ladder
10. Add individual disclaimers under each testimonial image

### üü¢ BEST PRACTICES (Reduces Review Risk):
11. Add "Educational purposes only" near headline
12. Use "Learn to" instead of "Get" or "Achieve"
13. Emphasize training/tools over outcomes
14. Make disclaimers larger and more visible

---

## Ad Copy Guidelines

### ‚ùå BAD (Will Get Rejected):
"Launch your AI agency in 30 days! Book your first client with our proven system.
Guaranteed results or your money back."

### ‚úÖ GOOD (Ad-Safe):
"AI Agency Training & Mentorship. Learn voice agents, automations, and outreach.
Step-by-step templates + weekly support. Limited-time founders pricing."

---

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Meta Ads (Facebook/Instagram):
- **Stricter** on income/business opportunity claims
- Manual review likely for business opportunity category
- Use "Special Ad Category" if targeting based on age/location
- Expect 24-48 hour review times
- Appeal rejections with proof of disclaimers

### YouTube Ads (Google Ads):
- Stricter on "get rich quick" schemes
- Automated + manual review
- Landing page must match ad claims
- Cannot show earnings or testimonials with specific results
- Must have clear, conspicuous disclaimers

---

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Compliance Testing
1. Run small test campaign ($20/day)
2. Monitor for rejections
3. Screenshot any rejection reasons
4. Adjust language based on feedback

### Phase 2: Creative Split Testing
1. Test multiple headline variations
2. A/B test disclaimer prominence
3. Test emphasis on "training" vs "tools"
4. Monitor account health score
