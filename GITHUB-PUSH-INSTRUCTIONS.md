# üö® GitHub Push Instructions

## Issue Identified

The provided GitHub token has **read-only permissions** and cannot push to the repository. The token works for API calls but lacks the necessary `repo` (write) scope.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Generate New Token with Correct Permissions

### Step 1: Create New Personal Access Token

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token"** ‚Üí **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Name: `mentorship-2-deployment`
4. Expiration: Choose appropriate duration (30-90 days recommended)
5. **Select scopes**:
   - ‚úÖ **`repo`** (Full control of private repositories) ‚Üê **REQUIRED**
   - ‚úÖ **`workflow`** (Update GitHub Actions) ‚Üê Optional but recommended
6. Click **"Generate token"**
7. **COPY THE TOKEN IMMEDIATELY** (you won't see it again)

---

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

Once you have the new token, run these commands:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/project/skoolmonymodule2/ai-agency-funnel/dev

# Remove old remote
git remote remove origin

# Add new remote with YOUR_NEW_TOKEN
git remote add origin https://YOUR_NEW_TOKEN@github.com/AltusSnyman/mentorship-2.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_NEW_TOKEN` with the token you just generated.

---

## Alternative: Use GitHub CLI (Easier)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/project/skoolmonymodule2/ai-agency-funnel/dev

# Login with browser
gh auth login

# Push to GitHub
gh repo create AltusSnyman/mentorship-2 --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

---

## Alternative: Use GitHub Desktop

1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com
2. File ‚Üí Add Local Repository
3. Select: `/mnt/c/project/skoolmonymodule2/ai-agency-funnel/dev`
4. Click "Publish repository"
5. Repository name: `mentorship-2`
6. Click "Publish"

---

## ‚úÖ Repository is Ready

All code is committed locally and ready to push:
- ‚úÖ 2 commits created
- ‚úÖ All improvements implemented
- ‚úÖ Netlify config ready
- ‚úÖ Production build verified

**Only step remaining**: Push with a token that has `repo` permissions.

---

2. Deploy to Netlify:
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com
   - "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import from GitHub"
   - Select `AltusSnyman/mentorship-2`
   - Deploy (auto-detects `netlify.toml`)
